# Wiggle

Makes wiggly lines... in c++...

## CLI

I have not made a CLI, although trying to use the CLI pushes you into interactive mode for now.
So a command like `<your binary> anyargs` pushes you into interactive mode.

## Contribution

Feel free to add more types of wiggly lines.
I have also not optimised the code and trusted the compiler. The code is messy.
